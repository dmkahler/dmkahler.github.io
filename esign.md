This electronic signature verification uses a simple one-way hash noted in the signature image and alternate text as *Verification: XXXXXXXXXXXX*.  Use this hash to verify the date and type of document signed.  Since this is a one-way verification, you will need to contact me directly to confirm that the signature image is on the original document.
